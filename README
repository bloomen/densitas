densitas is a C++ library for density estimation of regression problems.

With densitas you can estimate the quantiles of the unknown probability
distribution around the true value for each event.

For further insight have a look at densitas/density_estimator.hpp

A real world example can be found at test/real_world_with_liblinear.cpp

To build and run the tests the following libraries are required:
- liblinear (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear)
- armadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net)
- libunittest (http://libunittest.sourceforge.net)
